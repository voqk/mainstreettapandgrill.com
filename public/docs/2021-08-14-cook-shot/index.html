<blockquote>
<p>A cook was shot early Saturday at a bar in Houston&rsquo;s Greater Heights area, police said.</p>
<p>Officers responded around 3 a.m. to a bar and grill on the 4000 block of North Main Street, where they found a man with a gunshot wound, said Lt. R. Willkens of the Houston Police Department.</p>
<p>Investigators believe there was a disturbance inside the bar that spilled into the parking lot, Willkens said. At some point, someone with a weapon entered the business through the back door and shot a part-time cook, striking the man in the shoulder and neck.</p>
<p>The victim, a man in his 40s, was taken to the hospital in serious condition.</p>
<p>Three unknown suspects fled in a navy SUV, Willkens said.</p>
<p>The building was struck with gunfire multiple times and rifle and pistol casings were scattered across the parking lot, Willkens said.</p>
<p>Anyone with information is asked to call the HPD Major Assaults unit.</p>
